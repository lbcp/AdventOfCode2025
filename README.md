# Advent Of Code 2025

Welcome to the [Advent of Code][aoc] Kotlin project created by [lbcp][github] using 
the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

I'll try my best to solve the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language. The code will be ugly and unoptimised, but I 
am dedicated to finish all 12 Puzzles. Some of them probably next year :-)
